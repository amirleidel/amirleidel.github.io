Title: Some renders of an Icosahedron I madeDate: 2025-08-06 17:00Category: GraphicsAuthor: AmirSummary:Cover: ../images/icosahedron-01-hres-shaded.png# IcosahedraThis week I was writing another raytracer using PGA (Projective Geoemtric Algebra). Here are some renders of an icosahedron that I made along the way.!['First Icosahedron'](../images/icosahedron-00.png)First try with low resolution.!['Higher res'](../images/icosahedron-00-hres.png)Higher resolution. The shading on these is flat shading with a light source at infinity.!['Circles around'](../images/icosahedron-01-hres-excircles.png)For fun, I played with some parameters and discovered that I can render the edges not just straight but also curved. In fact, in this image the circels are the ex-circles around the triangle faces.!['BW shading and ground'](../images/icosahedron-01-hres-shaded.png)Second version with depth attenuation black and white colormap. I also added a ground model that vanishes into the fog. !['BW and circles'](../images/icosahedron-01-hres-shaded-excircles.png)Circles!
