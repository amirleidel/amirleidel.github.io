# My list of books that I am reading right now.

Currently i am reading

> The Courage To Be Disliked 

> *by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga*

which Ive almost finished by now. I very much like the way it was written. It is a dialogue between a youth, who has a lot of questions but also many opinions and an unshakable philosopher that goes much into Adlerian psychology.

And there is also a second book I am reading, which is

> Semiosis

> *by Sue Burke*

This is a science fiction story about settlers that populate a new planet and how they come to interact with the sentient plants on that planet.
