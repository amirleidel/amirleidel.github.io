Title: Deriving the Catenary Curves ShapeDate: 2025-07-10Category: MathSummary: The shape a hanging rope makes, thats suspended between two points, is the catenary curve. Its functional equation can be derived using functional derivatives and calculus of variations.Author: AmirLets say we have a rope of given length $\ell$ thats suspended between a gap of width $W$. Mechanically, this system should find an equilibrium that minimizes the potential energy of the rope itself. Just think of it this way, in case the rope would have been suspended on just one side it would hang down straight, because then every piece of it is as low as possible, therefore minimizing its potential energy. This means that we need to consider the differential of the energy $\mathrm{d}E$, which is the energy contribuition of every mass piece of the rope $\mathrm{d}m$. It is simply given by$$    \mathrm{d}E = \mathrm{d}m g f(x),$$which is analogous to $mgh$, expect that the height level of this piece corresponds to the function $f(x)$ that we want to find. Also, the mass differential $\mathrm{d}m$ depends on the piece of length of the rope via a linear mass density constant $\mu$, we therefore write$$    \mathrm{d}m = \mu \mathrm{d}\ell.$$Lastly, we need to have an expression for the length of the curve $\mathrm{d}\ell$. The Pythagorean theorem tell us that$$    \mathrm{d}\ell^2 = \mathrm{d} x^2 + \mathrm{d} y^2.$$And the height differential if just the rate of change of the function $f$ between the points $x$ and $x +\mathrm{d} x$, wherefore we can write$$    \mathrm{d} y = f(x + \mathrm{d}x) - f(x).$$The Taylor approximation of $f(x + \mathrm{d}x)$ then shows us that$$    \mathrm{d} y = f(x) + \mathrm{d}x f'(x) - f(x) = \mathrm{d}x f'(x),$$where $ f'(x) = \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{ \mathrm{d} x} \Big|_x$ is the first derivative of $f$ evaluated at $x$. Plugging this into the equation of the length differential $\mathrm{d}\ell$ we get$$    \mathrm{d}\ell = \mathrm{d}x \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}.$$# Length and Energy functionalsAt this point we have everything set up to define our length and energy functionals. As functionals, they take as an argument a function $f$ and then return its total length as a curve and also its energy. They will be our starting point at using variational calculus as we can use them to find the curve that minimizes the total energy but also has exactly the required length $\ell$. Starting with the length functional $\mathsf{L}[f']$, it is obtained by carrying out the integral over $\mathrm{d} \ell$ between $\pm W/2$ as in$$    \mathsf{L}[f'] = \int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \mathrm{d} x \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}.$$This will serve as the constraint for our optimization problem. Also, note how it only depends on the derivative $f'$, which is analogous to the slope of the curve, but not on its exact shape.Similarly, the energy functional $\mathsf{E}[f,f']$ is defined by the integral over $\mathrm{d} E$, we get$$    \mathsf{E}[f,f'] = \int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \mathrm{d} x \mu g f(x) \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}.$$We would think that we can now solve our problem by extremizing just the energy functional $\mathsf{E}[f,f']$, after all, we want to minimize the energy of the system. But, in absence of a constraint on $f$, this would yield somethingm like a U-shaped function stretching to $-\infty$. We have to keep in mind that our solution should respect$$    \mathsf{L}[f'] - \ell = 0.$$This problem can be solved by introducing the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ and a constrained energy functional $$    \mathsf{C}[f,f'] = - \mathsf{E}[f,f'] + \lambda \mathsf{L}[f'],$$which we are going to maximize. This is very similar to the action functional in mechanics, except that we are dealing with a static system without time, so there is no action but only energy considerations. By plugging in, the full constrained energy functional is given as$$    \mathsf{C}[f,f'] = \int_{-W/2}^{W/2}  \mathrm{d} x \underbrace{ (\lambda -\mu g f(x)) \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}}_{\mathcal{L}(x,f,f')}.$$Analogously to classical mechanics, the term inside the integral $\mathcal{L}(x,f,f')$ is the Lagrangian function. In order to extremize this lagrangian we take its total derivative $\mathrm{d} \mathcal{L}$, which is$$    \mathrm{d} \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(x,f+\delta f, f'+\delta f') - \mathcal{L}(x,f,f')$$which can be Taylor approximated to first order as$$    \mathrm{d} \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(x,f,f') + \mathrm{d} f \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f} + \mathrm{d}f' \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f'} - \mathcal{L}(x,f,f') \\    = \mathrm{d} f \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f} + \mathrm{d} f' \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f'}.$$In the last expression we need to get rid of the derivative of the differential $\mathrm{d} f'$, which is possible using partial integration, because the Lagrangian is the integrand of the functional $\mathsf{C}[f,f']$. Using partial integration we can therefore exchange the derivative with respect to $x$ to yield only terms in $\mathrm{d} f$. So we can write $$    \mathrm{d} \mathcal{L}    = \mathrm{d} f \left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f'} \right].$$Which is the Euler-Lagrange equation for this system, by requiring that $\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathcal{L}}{\mathrm{d}f} = 0$, wherefore we need to have$$    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f'} = 0.$$Calculating the derivatives we get that$$    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f} = - \mu g \sqrt{1 + f'^2}$$and $$    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f'} = (\lambda - \mu g f ) \frac{f'}{\sqrt{1 + f'^2}}.$$The last term has to be differentiated again with respect to $x$ to yield$$    \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f'} = - \mu g \frac{f'^2}{\sqrt{1 + f'^2}} + (\lambda - \mu g f) \frac{f''}{\sqrt{1 + f'^2}^3}.$$This is also where we used that the mass density is constant $\frac{\mathrm{d} \mu}{\mathrm{d} x} = 0$, which would not be true for a rope that got weights attached to it for example. Plugging these derivatives into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives us$$    - \mu g \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2} + \mu g \frac{f'^2}{\sqrt{1 + f'^2}} - (\lambda - \mu g f) \frac{f''}{\sqrt{1 + f'^2}^3} = 0.$$Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{1 + f'^2}^3$ then simplifies all this to$$    \mu g (1 + f'^2)+ (\lambda - \mu g f) f'' = 0.$$We can reshape this differential equation as$$    \left( f - \frac{\lambda}{\mu g} \right) f'' - \left( 1 + f'^2 \right) = 0,$$where only the Lagrange multiplier is scaled by the constants $\mu$ and $g$. Physically, this is interesting because it means that the solution function $f$ will be independent of them. Therefore the shape of the curve wont depend on the weight of the rope used and it also wont depend on the gravitational acceleration. So, a steel chain and a light rope will make the same shape, also not just on earth, but on the moon as well for example. # Solution of the ODEThe solution function for this differential equation is given by the hyperbolic cosine function$$    f(x) = a \left( \cosh \frac{x}{a}+ b \right),$$with $a,b$ being constants. Requiring this function to be zero at the suspension points we have that $f(\pm\frac{W}{2}) = 0$ and therefore the constant $b$ is determined as$$    b = -\cosh \frac{W}{2a}.$$Lastly, in order to determine $a$ we have to require the length constraint $ \mathsf{L}[f'] - \ell = 0$. Plugging in the derivative $f'(x) = \sinh \frac{x}{a}$ we get$$    \ell = \int_{W/2}^{W/2} \mathrm{d} x \sqrt{1 + \sinh^2{\frac{x}{a}}} = \int_{W/2}^{W/2} \mathrm{d} x \cosh{\frac{x}{a}}.$$Where we used the hyperbolic trigonometric identity $\cosh^2\alpha - \sinh^2\alpha = 1$. Taking the integral, we then obtain the equation$$    \ell = 2 a \sinh \frac{W}{2a},$$which is not algebraically solvable for $a$. So for a given length of the curve $\ell$, we would have to obtain the parameter $a$ numerically for example. But as a rough approximation we can use the function $$    a(\ell) \approx \frac{W}{3\sqrt{3\ln\frac{\ell}{W}}}.$$So, depending on $W$ and $\ell$, the shape of the catenary is approximately equal to the function $$    f(x) = \frac{W}{3\sqrt{3\ln{\frac{\ell}{W}}}} \left[ \cosh \left( \frac{3x}{W}\sqrt{3\ln{\frac{\ell}{W}}}  \right) - \cosh \left( \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{3\ln{\frac{\ell}{W}}}\right)\right].$$Since we centered the curve around zero, the value of $f(0)$ describes how far (in negative units) the rope is hanging down at its lowest point, also called its sag, for this we get$$    f(0) = \frac{W}{3\sqrt{3\ln{\frac{\ell}{W}}}} \left[ 1 - \cosh \left( \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{3\ln{\frac{\ell}{W}}}\right)\right].$$
