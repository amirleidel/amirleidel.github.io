# Update on what I am reading as of this month.

So, I wanted to  post something again, after a brief hiatus.
Currently, I am often outside, trying to get as much sun as possible
and then I can best read something when I am on my own.

> The House of the Spirits 
> _by Isabel Allende_

Just a few weeks ago I found this book in a box outside. 
It was intriguing because I wondered if the author has any conmection
to the chilean politician [Salvador Allende](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende)
and it turns out shes his niece! 

Apart from that I am roughly halfway through and the protagonists
are captivatingly lively in a kind of way and I enjoy its 
magical elements that feel truly believable and in character.
