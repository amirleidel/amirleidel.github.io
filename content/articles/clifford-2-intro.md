Take addition and multiplication, first defined on natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$, they can be extended to the whole $\mathbb{Z}$, the rational $\mathbb{Q}$, and real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, all with their own addition and multiplication. Another great milestone in the generalization of these notions was the introduction of vectors. The concept of the mathematical structure of a vector space is as universal as it gets. No wonder then, that it has extensive use in physics. Now, take a vector space, every element $x$ in it can be added to another element and we also have additive inverses, just take $-x$, as expected. But what about products? In fact, the definition of a vector space does not come with a multiplication of vectors. Just from the standpoint of doing physics, this is bad news, since arguably our most important mathematical operation does not carry over as beautifully as it does between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$.But wait, you might say, 'Don't we have the dot, or scalar product?' To answer that I say, that its just what its name says, a scalar valued product. This means, that the result is not a vector any more, which spells bad news for the existence of an inverse. Think of it, all of the information thats inside two multi-dimensional vectors gets lost when we take their scalar product, which is just a number. Even the cross product of two vectors, which might seem to fit the bill, as it returns a vector, is neither associative, nor does it have an inverse, nor does it work outside of 3D space.On the other hand, the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$, which is just a two dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, possesses a multiplication operation and even multiplicative inverses. _So, saying that you cannot divide by vectors, cannot be wholly truthful!__Could there be a way to equip our well known vectors spaces $\mathbb{R}^2$ (or even $\mathbb{R}^3$...) with a physically useful multiplication and division, much in the same way as the complex numbers?_## Part two: Play with a new ProductLet us see, how such a multiplication could behave in two dimensions. In the following we will denote it by juxtaposing two vectors $a,b \to ab$. This means we omit the symbol inbetween. Also, note that I wont mark the vectors with an arrow or boldface notation. This will declutter the equations.Start with the condition, that the product simplifies to the dot product, if we multiply a vector $$a = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{bmatrix}$$with itself, so$$ a a = a \cdot a = a_1^2 + a_2^2.$$If we now want to look what this means, we can expand $a = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2$ in the orthonormal basis $\langle e_1,e_2 \rangle$. We have already done that above, because we just have to identify the symbols $e_i$:$$ a = a_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + a_2 \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$where$$ e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \\e_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}. $$Taking the geometric product at this point and distributing it over the basis elements results in$$ a_1^2 e_1^2+ a_2^2 e_2^2 + a_1 a_2 \left(e_1 e_2 + e_2 e_1 \right) = a_1^2 + a_2^2.$$We remember that the last equality is what we want such that $aa = a \cdot a$. Therefore this splits into three equations that have to be fulfilled, these are$$ a_1^2 e_1^2 = a_1^2 \\a_2^2 e_2^2 = a_2^2 \\a_1 a_2 \left(e_1 e_2 + e_2 e_1 \right) = 0.$$And since these equation are fulfilled for every arbitrary $a_1$ and $a_2$, it follows that$$ e_1^2 = 1 \\e_2^2 = 1 \\e_1 e_2 + e_2 e_1 = 0.$$The first two conditions are the same as saying that the geometric product of a vector by itself equals the scalar product, since $e_i^2 = e_i \cdot e_i = 1$ for $i \in \{1,2\}$. However the third condition tells us something new. We now see that two orthogonal vectors behave as in$$ e_1 e_2 = - e_2 e_1. $$This means they _anticommute_, we can exchange them but have to flip the sign in that process.The result of this product, $e_1e_2$ is identified as a new element, similarly to a new vector $e_3$ thats not inside $\langle e_1,e_2 \rangle$, but it turns out that $e_1e_2$ has some new properties that distinguish it from a vector! Since it is the product of two vectors, lets call it a _bivector_ and we continue to denote it by abbreviating to $e_{12}$.## Part three: Bivectors and Plane RotationsLooking at the square of this bivector $e_{12}$, we get $$ e_{12}^2 = e_1 e_2 e_1 e_2. $$We then use anticommuting property to exchange the last two indices and simplify,$$ -e_1 \left( e_2  e_2 \right) e_1 = - e_1 e_1 = -1. $$This marks the first difference to the vectors, namely its square is negative, very interesting! This is like the well known imaginary unit $\mathbf{i}$. But in contrast to the imaginary unit, we can also figure out how it multiplies with the basis vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$:$$ e_{12} e_1 = e_1 e_2 e_1 = - e_2 \\e_{12} e_2 = e_1 e_2 e_2 = e_1$$Looking at this, it is the same as rotating the basis vectors by $90°$ forward (counter-clockwise). So, in general, applying $e_{12}$ to the vector $a$ changes its orientation to yield a vector $a_\perp$,$$e_{12} a = - a_1 e_2 + a_2 e_1 = a_\perp$$which is orthogonal to $a$. This is because $a \cdot a_\perp = 0$. ![Rotating a vector by e12](../images/a-flip.svg 'Rotating a vector by e12')Btw, this relation $e_{12} a = a_\perp$ also explains the property of $e_{12}$ to square to $-1$, since applying $e_{12}$ twice to a vector flips it by $180°$, which is the same as multiplying the vector by $-1$.We can also use the whole might of complex analysis and look at Eulers formula, using the bivector $e_{12}$ it now looks like$$ R = \mathrm{e}^{e_{12} \varphi} = \cos{\varphi} + e_{12} \sin{\varphi}.$$This element $R$ is called a rotor and it is the first mixed object we encounter, since it consists of a scalar part and a bivectorial part, this is the same as the real and imaginary part of complex numbers. Its name comes from its ability to rotate vectors. For example, applying it to the vector $a = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2$ from the left yields$$R a =  \left( \cos{\varphi} + e_{12} \sin{\varphi} \right) a \\= \cos{\varphi} a + \sin{\varphi} e_{12} a,$$therefore$$ R a = \cos{\varphi} a + \sin{\varphi} a_\perp. $$Which is a rotation of $a$. In fact, in order to find out more about the result of $R a$, expand the expression to vector notation. Note that $$R a = \left( \cos{\varphi} a_1 + \sin{\varphi} a_2 \right) e_1 + \left( -\sin{\varphi} a_1 + \cos{\varphi} a_2 \right) e_2$$and hence$$    R a =     \begin{bmatrix}        \cos{\varphi} a_1 + \sin{\varphi} a_2 \\        -\sin{\varphi} a_1 + \cos{\varphi} a_2     \end{bmatrix}    \\    =     \begin{bmatrix}        \cos{\varphi} & \sin{\varphi} \\        -\sin{\varphi} &         \cos{\varphi}     \end{bmatrix}    \begin{bmatrix}        a_1 \\ a_2    \end{bmatrix}.$$And now we see clearly that we have just provided a rotation of $a$, by deriving the rotation matrix in the two dimensional plane from the properties of the geometric product. But dont confuse both sides of the equation, _$R$ is not a matrix_ but the scalar-bivector element $\mathrm{e}^{e_{12} \varphi}$, that we got by adapting Eulers formula. ## Last part: Wrapping all of this upWe introduced the _geometric product_ as a product between vectors, that is associative and distributive and that decides to be commuting or anticommuting depending if two vectors are parallel or orthogonal. In essence_$$    e_i e_j = \begin{cases}1, & i = j \\- e_j e_i, & i \neq j \end{cases}$$_By this, we obtained a new kind of object $e_{12}$. It turned out to square to a negative number _$e_{12}^2 = -1$_, making it equivalent, in its use, to the imaginary unit $\mathbf{i}$ of the complex plane. All of this is a new kind of mathematical construct 'on top' of our vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is the _Geometric Algebra $\mathcal{Cl}(2)$_.![A diagram of the Clifford Algebra in 2D](../images/cl2.svg 'A diagram of the Clifford Algebra in 2D')It contains objects called blades, which are the scalars, vectors $e_1$,$e_2$ and a bivector $e_{12}$. Each has a different grade, the scalars are defined as having grade $0$, the vectors have grade $1$ and bivectors have grade $2$. The most general kind of element $A \in \mathcal{Cl}(2)$ is a multivector, a mixed grade object, which cannot be written as a blade (or a multiple of one), such as_$$    A = \alpha + a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \beta e_{12} $$_The rotor $R$, that possessed only components of even grade $0$ and $2$, is an element of the even subalgebra of $\mathcal{Cl}(2,0)$, which is denoted $\mathcal{Cl^+}(2,0) \ni \alpha + \beta e_{12}$. This even subalgebra is exactly what is isomorphic to the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. So, the geometric algebra of the two dimensional plane includes both, and presents us the connection between, $\mathbb{C}$ and the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$. The former, the complex plane being isomorphic to the even subalgebra $\mathcal{Cl^+}(2,0)$. The latter, the odd grade $1$ elements, which do not form a subalgebra, giving us the familiar vector space back, spanned by the basis vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$.To conclude our investigation in two dimensions, lets also answer the question of division by a vector $a \neq 0$. Just take the equation $a a = a \cdot a$ and divide by the right-hand side to yield$$    a \frac{a}{a \cdot a} = 1 .$$Et voilà, we see that the _inverse of $a$_ is another vector thats parallel to it$$a^{-1} = \frac{a}{|a|^2} = \frac{a_1}{a_1^2 + a_2^2} e_1 + \frac{a_2}{a_1^2 + a_2^2} e_2.$$As a final note, we don't have to be careful about using a fraction for denoting division, since $a \cdot a$ is a scalar. But in the vector and multivector case, the geometric product is not commutative in general. Meaning, we should stick to writing $a b^{-1}$ instead of $\frac{a}{b}$, since the latter could just as well be read as $b^{-1} a$ and if $a,b$ are both vectors for example, then $a b^{-1} \neq b^{-1} a$ in general._Thus, we have unified 2D vector and complex algebra into one subject by using the Geometric Algebra._
