Title: Pentagon the goDate: 2025-01-01 12:00Category: GeometryAuthors: AmirSummary: Constructing a pentagon using one fold.Cover: ../images/pentagon2.svg# Constructing a pentagon using one fold.The regular pentagon is a constructible polygon, which means you can draw it using just straightedge and compass. But in contrast to the triangle, square and hexagon it is quite a bit more involved. So if you dont care about cheating and need one on the go you can actually do it in just a few obvious steps.Starting with a line $AB$, bisect it by a second line $C$. Then, at $A$, draw a circle $D$ with radius one half $AB$.Tangent to the circle $D$, create a fold $F$ such that $C$ passes through $B$.This fold corresponds to a symmetry axis of the pentagon and it lays $C$ on top of the line $C'$ thats shown in the diagram.![Creating the fold](../images/pentagon1a.svg 'Creating the fold')At $B$, draw a circle with radius $AB$ and call it $E$. The further point of the intersection of $E$ with $F$ is now the third point of the pentagon $G$.![Constructing the thrid point](../images/pentagon1.svg 'Drawing the third point')Analogously, you can now find all other remaining points $G$, $H$, and $I$ by drawing circles and connecting them with straight lines to form a pentagon. The main challenge was kind of in constructing the third point of the pentagon. ![Finished pentagon](../images/pentagon2.svg 'Finished pentagon')An interesting idea would now be to use a similar method for drawing a heptagon, since it is not constructible by compass and straightedge alone, so at least one fold has to be involved in that case.
