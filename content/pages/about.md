Summary: My about page

I started this blog in late 2021 during my undergrad as a way to delve into physics and math, exploring
these interests for myself outside of the dry and unintuitive lectures. In essence, by following curious
everyday things, I would like to encourage both myself and others to delve deeper and think about what
makes the things around us do what they do.

I hope you will find something intriguing among my projects, where I attempt to apply my knowledge of
physics to seemingly ordinary things in order to understand and describe them.

If you come across something you would like to talk about, please feel free to contact me at my email
adress or using my social media handles provided below.

Stay safe and have a nice time.
