Summary: My about page

Hey! 

Let me introduce myself, I am _Amir_ and your friendly neighborhood
webmaster around here. 

What I want to do is share my thoughts ans ideas, somehow
bringing them into the outside world. I feel like thinking 
around is very nice and all, but only when you do something
wigh those ideas and finally write them down do they become
reality. 

So, thats what this website is all about. Nowadays social media
are more crowded than ever, everything is full of content and 
people and interaction! But also somehow it really does feel
more dead than ever. The modern internet is there to generate
money and it does its job very well. Short content, cluttered
with advertisement, destroys our attention span. Every second
youre a datapoint in a sea of billions, that feeds algorithms
that decide whats best for you. --- No, I wont pay for your
fucking subscription service!

Sorry, lets get back on track. I just feel like I am yearning
for a simpler web, one thats more personal at the same time.

Even though I first started with this webpage in 2021, I
rebuilt it multiple times so lets see how long this iteration
lasts. Feel free to browse around and also give me some feedback
if you have the time to do so. 

In the beginning, I started this blog during my undergrad 
as a way to delve into physics and math, 
exploring these interests for myself outside of the 
dry and unintuitive lectures. In essence, by following 
curious everyday things, I would like to encourage both 
myself and others to delve deeper and think about what 
makes the things around us do what they do.

Maybe you will find something intriguing among all the project
I am so passionate about or the bits and pieces of my interests.
Anyway, have a good time!
